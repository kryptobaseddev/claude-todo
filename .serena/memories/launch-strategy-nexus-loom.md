# Launch Strategy: Nexus Loom Rebranding

**Created**: 2025-12-13
**Status**: Strategy complete, awaiting execution decisions

## Strategic Framework

Comprehensive go-to-market strategy for rebranding claude-todo → Nexus Loom and launching to AI developer community.

### Document Location
`/mnt/projects/claude-todo/LAUNCH-STRATEGY.md`

## Key Strategic Decisions Required

### 1. Branding Confirmation
**Decision**: Rebrand to "Nexus Loom" vs. stay "claude-todo"
**Recommendation**: Rebrand
**Rationale**: 
- "claude-todo" sounds generic, limits market
- "Nexus Loom" conveys orchestration, AI-era positioning
- Better trademark/domain availability

### 2. Monetization Model
**Options**:
- A) Pure open source (GitHub Sponsors)
- B) Freemium (CLI free, Web UI paid)
- C) Team pricing (free for 1-5, paid for teams)
**Recommendation**: Start A, evaluate B in Phase 4

### 3. Competition Posture
**Decision**: Collaborative vs. competitive with Beads
**Recommendation**: Collaborative
**Rationale**: 
- Small market, benefit from shared growth
- Propose shared AI task management spec
- Differentiate on maturity/features, not direct attack
