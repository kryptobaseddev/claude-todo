/**
 * Locating a worktree by asking git (T12086).
 *
 * The bug these guard is not a crash — it is a cleanup verb that reports
 * `worktreeRemoved: true, branchDeleted: true` while the directory, the git
 * registration, and the branch all still exist. Measured 2026-08-06: 23
 * worktrees destroyed "successfully", zero actually removed, because
 * `destroyWorktree` recomputed the path from the CURRENT project-hash scheme
 * and assumed the branch was `task/<taskId>` with no slug.
 *
 * 42 worktrees accumulated behind that silent success.
