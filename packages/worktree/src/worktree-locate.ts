/**
 * Locate a task's worktree by asking git, not by recomputing a path (T12086).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `destroyWorktree` derived everything by convention:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const worktreePath = resolveTaskWorktreePath(computeProjectHash(projectRoot), taskId);
 * const branch = `task/${taskId}`;
 * ```
 *
 * Both assumptions fail in the field, and both fail **silently reporting
 * success**:
 *
 * 1. **The path.** `computeProjectHash` produces the CURRENT hash scheme. A
 *    worktree provisioned under an earlier scheme lives at a different
 *    directory, so `existsSync(worktreePath)` is false and the code takes its
 *    `else` branch — `worktreeRemoved = true // already gone` — for a worktree
 *    that is still registered and still on disk. Measured 2026-08-06: 23
 *    worktrees under `…/worktrees/L21udC9wcm9qZWN0cy9jbGVvY29kZQ/` all reported
 *    `worktreeRemoved: true` and none were touched.
 *
 * 2. **The branch.** Real branches carry a slug — `task/T11248-cleo-exodus`,
 *    not `task/T11248`. `git branch --list task/T11248` matches nothing, the
 *    delete is skipped, and `branchDeleted = true` is returned anyway.
 *
 * The cost of a cleanup verb that claims success without acting is not one bad
 * call — it is that nobody notices the mess growing. 42 worktrees accumulated
 * behind exactly this.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * `git worktree list --porcelain` is the authoritative registry of what exists
 * and which branch each entry has checked out. Ask it. Fall back to the
 * computed path only when git knows nothing, and then say so.
 *
 * @task T12086
